# Assignment 1: Website Review

+ # Visual Hierarchy
### **My first impression of the website**
When you first open The New Level Brewing's website, the user will notice the **_extensive logo_**. They used a font that is hard for users to read and added strong colors. At first, the website is not appealing but as you scroll through it starts getting more appealing. They have made it more user friendly.  

 ### **The Goals of the website**

The Ross Brothers decided to start their own brewery, the website includes the list of beers that they have crafted. They started their own merchandise which advertises their company. The goal of this website is to advertise their journey and how they came up with the ideas.   

### **How visual Hierarchy effecting the website** 

The website starts off with an obnoxious typography of their company logo, it is not easy to read but compliments their style. They balanced it out by using the  **_rule of odds_** on their social media icons. 


The body of this website is using the **_size and scale_** rule which makes their list of beers easier to find, also their proximity creates a better understanding and more organized for the users. **_The alignment_** is more on being centered rather than the F pattern. The whole theme of the website contains enough **_negative space_** for users to focus more on their advertisement expect they could give more negative space around their logo area. The repetition of design makes it more appealing for the audience since they use the same font and colors and following **_visual hierarchy_** conventions.

+ # Mental Models and Usability

### **Violation on convention**

**_For the violence on conventions_**, user might think this website is for metal rock band fans retail store because they sell own merchandise quite a lot, although it is pub websites.
### **Scannable Content**
**_The content is scannable_** because the website is mostly constructed by images and bold text. However, the body text font that the web creator choose is a medieval style which makes it difficult to read for the user, because it is not standard. In addition, the main colours of this website, purple and yellow, are harsh on the eyes due to the high saturation, especially in low light conditions.  Besides, the website doesn’t support laptop screen sizes which makes it harder for laptop users.  When you open the website with a laptop, you can only see some parts of the website, it seems to be more zoomed in and it cuts off the side, making it more difficult to browse. 

### **Low Contrast ratio**

>The title of brews menu contrast ratio was 2.43:1 which is lower than 3:1 contrast ratio for large text. It’ll be laborious for persons with disabilities user.  

 + # Mobile Responsiveness 

### **_Scroll Track on mobile devices_**
The mobile version of this website has scroll track on mobile device also has scroll back to top button for makes more convenient and responsive. 

### **_Online menu / Responsive / QR code_**
This website does not have an online menu, but there is crafted beer delivery. **The hamburger** menu; top right of corner, includes eight categories and create website simple support mobile users to operate the website easily. In addition, hamburger menu helping **viewport** looks organized and balanced because removed other options to hamburger menu. Therefore, there is more negative space on webpage and made it easier to browse the website compared to desktop and laptop. **Media queries**; webpage content is adapted to mobile screen sizes comfortably fit and looks better than desktop.
